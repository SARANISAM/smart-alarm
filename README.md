# Smart Label-Based Alarm Clock

A smart alarm system that automatically selects ringtones based on **user-defined labels** like *Wake Up*, *Workout*, *Meditation*, *Study*, etc.  
It integrates with **YouTube API** (or similar music APIs) to fetch and play songs/sounds that match the chosen label, making alarms more personalized and engaging.

## API Usage

The app integrates with **YouTube API** to fetch alarm sounds dynamically:  

1. **Search Request**  
   When a user sets an alarm with a label (e.g., `Workout`), the app sends a query
2. **Get Video ID**  
The API returns a list of YouTube videos. The app selects one (random or top result) using its `videoId`.
3. **Play Video**  
The selected `videoId` is embedded in an `<iframe>` or played using the **YouTube Player API** at alarm time.
